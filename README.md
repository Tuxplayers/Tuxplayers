## 🎵 Music, Songwriting & Home Recording

I write and produce music and songs in my home studio – from first idea to finished arrangement and mix.

**DAWs & Tools:**  
- **Bitwig Studio:** Modern, modular DAW for creative production, sound design, jamming, and live performance. Especially strong for flexible workflows, experimental sounds, and stable on Linux.
- **Reaper:** Highly flexible, lightweight DAW with excellent routing, automation, customization possibilities, and a huge user community. Perfect for recording, editing, mixing, and mastering – runs reliably on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

**Instruments & musical skills:**  
- 🎹 Piano / Keyboard  
- 🥁 Drums  
- 🎤 Vocals  
- 🎸 Guitar

I combine classic songwriting with modern audio engineering. I regularly work on composition, sound design, and mixing—always exploring new plugins, sound libraries, and production methods.
